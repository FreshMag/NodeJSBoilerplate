# NodeJSBoilerplate
Simple boilerplate for creating easy, simple and lightweight static websites using NodeJS

## Used resources

In this boilerplate you can find:

- Nodejs + Express
- A very simple database using [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)
- Other utils like routers and controllers already organized
- Static resources as well as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) ready to be used inside your HTML pages

## Future updates

Probably going to update this boilerplate adding some template engine (like [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)) and some basic authentication system
